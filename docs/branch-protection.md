# Branch Protection Setup

This document describes how to configure branch protection rules for the Writigo repository.

## üõ°Ô∏è Branch Protection Configuration

### GitHub Repository Settings

Navigate to **Settings ‚Üí Branches** in your GitHub repository and add the following protection rules:

#### Protection Rule for `main` Branch

```yaml
Branch name pattern: main
Settings:
  ‚úÖ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB
  ‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
    ‚úÖ Require approvals: 1 (minimum)
    ‚úÖ Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
    ‚úÖ Require review from code owners
    ‚úÖ Restrict reviews to users with write access
  ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
    ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
    Required status checks:
      - test (CI/CD Pipeline)
      - build (if applicable)
  ‚úÖ Require conversation resolution before merging
  ‚úÖ Require signed commits (recommended)
  ‚úÖ Include administrators (apply rules to admins too)
  ‚úÖ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB
```

#### Protection Rule for `dev` Branch

```yaml
Branch name pattern: dev
Settings:
  ‚úÖ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB
  ‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
    ‚úÖ Require approvals: 1 (minimum)
    ‚úÖ Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
  ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
    ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
    Required status checks:
      - test (CI/CD Pipeline)
  ‚úÖ Require conversation resolution before merging
  ‚úÖ Include administrators
```

## üîÑ Workflow Enforcement

### Automated Checks

Our CI/CD pipeline automatically runs:
- Unit tests (Jest + pytest)
- Integration tests
- Linting (ESLint + Black + isort)
- Type checking (TypeScript + mypy)
- Security scans

### Manual Review Requirements

#### For `dev` branch merges:
- [ ] Code review by team member
- [ ] All automated checks pass
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
- [ ] Tests added for new functionality

#### For `main` branch merges:
- [ ] All dev branch requirements met
- [ ] Integration testing completed on dev
- [ ] Release notes prepared
- [ ] Admin/maintainer approval

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### Hotfix Process

For critical production issues:

```bash
# 1. Create hotfix from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-issue-description

# 2. Make minimal fix
# ... implement fix ...

# 3. Test thoroughly
npm run test
npm run git:prepare-pr

# 4. Create PR to main (emergency approval)
git push origin hotfix/critical-issue-description

# 5. After merge, sync with dev
git checkout dev
git pull origin main  # Fast-forward or merge main into dev
```

### Branch Protection Override

In extreme emergencies, administrators can:
1. Temporarily disable branch protection
2. Make direct commits
3. Re-enable protection immediately
4. Document the override in incident reports

## üìã Compliance Checklist

Before enabling branch protection:

- [ ] CI/CD pipeline is working correctly
- [ ] All team members understand the workflow
- [ ] Emergency procedures are documented
- [ ] Code owners file is configured (`.github/CODEOWNERS`)
- [ ] Status checks are properly configured

### CODEOWNERS Configuration

Create `.github/CODEOWNERS`:

```
# Global ownership
* @writigo-maintainers

# Frontend components
apps/editor/ @frontend-team
apps/web-ui/ @frontend-team

# Backend services
apps/api/ @backend-team
services/ @backend-team

# Documentation
docs/ @documentation-team
*.md @documentation-team

# Infrastructure
.github/ @devops-team
docker/ @devops-team
scripts/ @devops-team
```

## üîß Local Development Setup

### Git Hooks (Optional)

Add pre-commit hooks to enforce standards locally:

```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Setup hooks
pre-commit install
```

Create `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.4.0
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: check-json
      - id: check-yaml
      
  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 23.7.0
    hooks:
      - id: black
        language_version: python3
        
  - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/isort
    rev: 5.12.0
    hooks:
      - id: isort
```

This ensures code quality before commits reach the remote repository.
